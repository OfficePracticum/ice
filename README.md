If you are interested in receiving periodic e-mails pertinent to ICE, you may [subscribe to join the ICE Announcements E-mail List](https://groups.google.com/a/hln.com/forum/#!forum/ice-announcements). We send e-mail to this list when there is important information to share about new releases or relevant to the operation of ICE. This is a low-volume list and we do not share group members' e-mail addresses with anyone.
